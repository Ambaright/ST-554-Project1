        "##Introduction\n",
        "The increasing incidence of respiratory illness and the known carcinogenic risks associated with prolonged exposure to pollutants like benzene (C6H6) have made precise urban air quality monitoring a critical priority for public health and municipal traffic management. Currently, urban monitoring relies on sparse networks of fixed stations equipped with high-precision industrial spectrometers; however, the high cost and significant size of these instruments prevent the deployment of a monitoring mesh dense enough to capture the complex, turbulent diffusion of gases in a city environment. To address this gap, research has shifted toward low-cost gas multi-sensor devices, often termed \"electronic noses,\" which utilize solid-state sensors to provide a more granular view of urban pollution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided report examines data from a 13-month measurement campaign (March 2004 to April 2005) conducted along a high-traffic road in an Italian city. The study’s primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using these low-cost devices to \"densify\" existing monitoring networks by comparing their readings against \"Ground Truth\" (GT) reference data provided by a conventional monitoring station. The dataset includes hourly mean concentrations for several \"true\" pollutants - CO, NMHC, C6H6, NOx, and NO2 - recorded alongside the responses of five metal oxide chemoresistive sensors (targeted at CO, NMHC, NOx, NO2, and O3) and two sensors for weather-related variables, specifically temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH).\n",
        "\n",
        "A central focus of this analysis is the estimation of grount truth C6H6(benzene). Notably, the multi-sensor device used in the study did not include a sensor specifically targeted at benzene. Instead, the study aimed to reconstruct benzene levels by employing artificial neural networks to exploit the significant linear correlations that exist between different urban pollutants. For instance, a very strong correlation coefficient of 0.98 was observed between benzene and Non-Metanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC).\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the study investigates the critical role of atmospheric dynamics, as the stability and selectivity of solid-state sensors are heavily influenced by seasonal changes and weather variables. Earlier findings suggest that sensor performance can be impacted by rapid shifts in humidity and low temperatures, which may necessitate periodic re-calibration to account for sensor drift and changing gas mixture ratios in the winter.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this study, data from these environmental sensors is utilized to model the linear relationship between benzene (C6H6) and levels of other atmospheric pollutants. In order to find the ideal linear relationship parameters, we need to quantify the quality of predictions made by them. We can do this by using a loss function. A popularly utlized loss function for model fitting is the squared error loss and root mean squared error. The squared error loss represents the error between a single predicted value and its associated observed value. For a given set of data, we then consider the root mean squared error (rmse), which averages the squared error for each data point. When making predictions for atmospheric benzene levels, we want to choose predictions that minimize the rmse and therefore provide predictions closer to observed values.\n",
        "\n",
        "To look for linear parameters that minimize the loss function, we can use gradient descent algorithms. Gradient descent algorithms are a first-order iterative optimization technique used to find a local minimum of a differentiable function. In the realm of modeling data and fitting linear relationships between C6H6 and other environmental factors, gradient descent is a fundamental method of model training wherein the loss function is minimized, thereby reducing the error between the models predictions and the observed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two gradient descent approaches are taken in this study. The grid search algorithm is known as a brute force method in which generated predicted values or generated intercept and slope values are compared to observed values to determine either the ideal predicted value or intercept and slope. In the gradient descent method, the derivative of the function is taken to determine the slope and therefore the direction of the minimum of the loss function. Small steps are then taken in the direction of the minimum unitl a tolerance level is reached to determine the ideal predicted values or intercept and slope of the linear model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reading in and Cleaning the Data\n",
        "Before coding our gradient descent algorithms, we must first read in our dataset and ensure it is in a useable format. The dataset used for this study is made available by the University of California, Irvine. From the total dataset, a pandas dataframe of the important information is obtained and stored as `air_quality_df`.  "

This information is especially useful when generating predicted y values to test with our grid search algorithms."

With both the grid search and gradient descent methods, we were able to find the ideal y-intercept and slope for a linear relationship between carbon monoxide readings from a sensor and benzene levels in the atomosphere. Here, we see how two powerful gradient descent methods can be used to find ideal preditive parameters for a set of data. This shows how data science methods can be used to reveal relationships between data and make predictions in important, real-world applications.\n"
