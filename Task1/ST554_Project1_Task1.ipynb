        "##Introduction\n",
        "The increasing incidence of respiratory illness and the known carcinogenic risks associated with prolonged exposure to pollutants like benzene (C6H6(GT)) have made precise urban air quality monitoring a critical priority for public health and municipal traffic management. Currently, urban monitoring relies on sparse networks of fixed stations equipped with high-precision industrial spectrometers; however, the high cost and significant size of these instruments prevent the deployment of a monitoring mesh dense enough to capture the complex, turbulent diffusion of gases in a city environment. To address this gap, research has shifted toward low-cost gas multi-sensor devices, often termed \"electronic noses,\" which utilize solid-state sensors to provide a more granular view of urban pollution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided report examines data from a 13-month measurement campaign (March 2004 to April 2005) conducted along a high-traffic road in an Italian city. The study’s primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using these low-cost devices to \"densify\" existing monitoring networks by comparing their readings against \"Ground Truth\" (GT) reference data provided by a conventional monitoring station. The dataset includes hourly mean concentrations for several \"true\" pollutants - CO, NMHC, C6H6, NOx, and NO2 - recorded alongside the responses of five metal oxide chemoresistive sensors (targeted at CO, NMHC, NOx, NO2, and O3) and two sensors for weather-related variables, specifically temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH).\n",
        "\n",
        "A central focus of this analysis is the estimation of C6H6(GT) (benzene). Notably, the multi-sensor device used in the study did not include a sensor specifically targeted at benzene. Instead, the study aimed to reconstruct benzene levels by employing artificial neural networks to exploit the significant linear correlations that exist between different urban pollutants. For instance, a very strong correlation coefficient of 0.98 was observed between benzene and Non-Metanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC).\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the study investigates the critical role of atmospheric dynamics, as the stability and selectivity of solid-state sensors are heavily influenced by seasonal changes and weather variables. Earlier findings suggest that sensor performance can be impacted by rapid shifts in humidity and low temperatures, which may necessitate periodic re-calibration to account for sensor drift and changing gas mixture ratios in the winter.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this study, data from environmental sensors is utilized to model the level of benzene (C6H6) in the atmosphere based on the readingns of other atomospheric conditions. In order to find the ideal parameters by which to model and preidict benzene levels through other environmental factors, gradient descent algorithms can be utilized. Gradient descent algorithms are a first-order iterative optimization technique used to find a local minimum of a differentiable function. In the realm of modeling data and fitting linear relationships between C6H6 and other environmental factors, gradient descent is a fundamental method of model training wherein the loss function is minimized, thereby reducing the error between the models predictions and the observed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two gradient descent approaches are taken in this study. The grid search algorithm is known as a brute force method in which generated predicted values or generated intercept and slope values are compared to the observed values to determine either the ideal predicted value or intercept and slope. In the gradient descent method, the derivative of the function is taken to determine the slope and therefore the direction of the minimum of the function. Small steps are then taken in this direction unitl the loss function is minimized to determine the ideal predicted values or intercept and slope of the linear model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reading in and Cleaning the Data\n",
        "Before coding our gradient descent algorithms, we must first read in our dataset and ensure it is in a useable format. The dataset used for this study is made available by the University of California, Irvine. From the total dataset, a pandas dataframe of the important information is obtained and stored as `air_quality_df`.  "

        "This section contains grid search algorithms for the optimal prediction of benzene from other variables present in the dataset. The grid search will be conducted in two ways. In the Just y method, a set of generated predicted y values will be used to compare against the observed values of C6H6(GT). In the y and another numeric variable method, ideal intercept and slope values will be obtained so that benzene levels can be predicted with another numeric variable in the dataset. With this method, data obtained from sensors can be used to make predictions about the benzene levels in the atmosphere.  \n",
        "### Just y\n",
        "In the just y method, observed C6H6(GT) values from the dataset are utilized and compared to generated predicted values. No other variables are included. Essentially, we're seeing how far away the observed value is away from a created predicted value. These predicted values are organized in a list which forms the grid in this search method. To create the grid for this method, the `np.linspace()` function will be used to generate 100 values between the first and third quartlie of the data of the variable of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `rmse()` function takes in the record of observed y values and a certain preducted y value from the grid, and calculates the root mean squared error. This is the function we are aiming to minimize in our grid search algorithm."

In this approach, for each observation, the prediction is given by the linear relationship y = b0 +b1*x. As opposed to the scenario above, we know have a two dimensional grid where we want to compare each combination of b0 and b1 to find the ideal relationship between the x variable and y variable. The rmse function below follows the same principles as the previous rmse function, expect now we consider both the x and y value to see how far the value predicted by x is from the observed y value. In this grid search algorithm, we generate a grid for both the intercept (b0) and the slope (b1), and iterate through each combination of those while calculating and storing the rmse. The combination of b0 and b1 that produces the lowest rmse is considered the ideal predicting factors relating x to y."
