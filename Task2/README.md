Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

- Siona Benjamin
  + Change category variable name signifying if the sensor reading is low or high to something a little more descriptive to what the column is describing 
  + Add data type in function definitions
  + Consider comparing the ground truth measurements against sensor measurements 
  + Can use seaborn (or other python module) to quickly plot benzene vs other numeric variable to determine trends
  + Overall great job! Very thorough expalanation of the data, creation of new variables and visual analysis plans sound great!


- Michelle Silveira
  + I dont have any additional comment the foundation of this notebook is excellent — the data engineering and summary statistics work is thoughtful and well-narrated.
  + post adjustment feedback:
  + Very clear structure and flow: headings and progression feel like a real (advaced research) EDA report.
  + Good feature engineering for EDA: creating interpretable categories (high/low, season, time-of-day) helps tell a story about benzene behavior.
  + Good coverage of “time effects” beyond just one line plot (time-of-day and seasonal boxplots are especially useful).
  + Sections are written like a guided thought, good alignment with “walk the reader through your thinking
