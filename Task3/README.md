Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  + I liked how you stuck with the consistency of using a similar introduction as Siona and me, especially when it comes to introducing the data and why investigating `benzene` may be important. However, I would make sure to go back and modify the last paragraph so that it doesn't mention the EDA piece and instead replace with with a brief introduction on the Task 3 material.
  + For the section headers, I would switch where your main header is to the very top and add a second-level header for the Introduction and Reading in the Data sections.
  + Overall, the programming sections look great. I love all of the comments within the code block and the great docstrings in the user-defined functions. I also saw that you added in strings with your print statements to provide context on what is being printed. The bonus graphs also look visually appealing with good axis labels and an informative title.
  + My biggest piece of feedback is incorporating a narrative into your text blocks. Right now, it seems like a brain dump of what is being done; however, the project heavily emphasizes the importance of this being a narrative report. I would go into more detail, explaining in a paragraph format what Task 3 is hoping to achieve and why cross-validation is important, and how it works. Then be sure to have your text blocks be in a mostly paragraph form as you describe what is being done in your code.

  + Explicitly write our SLR (simple linear regression) and MLR (multiple linear regression) and explain what each of these methods do in the introduction or in the text areas where you use them
  + Tailor the introduction to include more explanation about your specific task
  + Feedback after edits were made: great updates to the introduction! I think the rest of the code is clearly labeled and easy to go through as well. The graphs at the end are also a great visual to see how the error progresses.
